# Battle
Once a hunter engages with a foe or a foe engages with a hunter, battle has commenced.

## Initiative
Before anything else, its up for the Host of the Nightmare to access the Initiative of each hunter and foe. Whoever rolls the highest value for initiative, gets to act first. Should a tie occur, the ones involved should reroll to determine their own unique order of action.

## Actions
Every hunter has 1 regular action + 1 movement action per round, where 1 regular action is equivalent to two movement actions. Free actions can also be performed at any point in the Battle.

### Regular Action
An action that takes a fairly significant time during battle or exposes the hunter to potential backlash. 
Hunters can spend Stamina Points to perform extra regular actions.
Hunters can also trade their regular action for two more movement actions.

#### Examples of Regular Action:

Attack

Activate Hunter Tool

Blood Communion

### Movement Action
A quick swift action that can be intertwined with other actions in combat.
A hunter can use a movement action to move about 6 meters in distance.

#### Examples of Movement Actions:

Use Buff (Fire Paper, Bolt Paper, Bone Marrow Ash)

Use Throwables (Molotovs, Pungent Blood Cocktail)

Use Vial of Blood

Charge Strong Attack

Parry

### Free Action
A highly accessible action from any point in engaged combat.

### Examples of Free Actions:

Communication

Transforming Trick Weapon

Perform Visceral Attack

### Attack
Hunters attack to destroy the beasts and render their foes broken.

An attack is usually defined by its Type. 

The Type of an attack determines the nature of the damage it will cause. 
An attack of STR type, will have its damage calculated with a STR roll.

Before the damage can be calculated however an ACC roll needs to be done to see if the attack hits. 
If it hits, the damage is then calculated accordingly.

IF two or more 10s showup in the roll, that is considered a critical hit. Criticals hit automatically and multiply the damage based on the multiplier of the attack performed. 

Each weapon has a multitude of attacks that can have different types, ranges, multipliers, modifiers and effects.

Modifiers add a regular value of damage to the attack, while the range determines how close the hunter has to be to his foe in order to perform the attack.

Effects can cause specific effects on foes that are hit. The Stagger effect reduces the guard level of the foe by a certain value once the foe is hit, increasing the chances of the hunter breaking his opponent guard. Other effects such as bolt, serrated, fire, can stun, inflict lasting damage or increase damage against certain enemy types amongst other possibilities.


### Activate Hunter Tool
Hunter Tools are objects infused with the Arcane and eldritch. Hunters can activate the innate power in these objects to access eldritch powers. Doing so however comes with a cost.

If the hunter tool causes any damage it will always be calculated by an Arcane roll + ARC. Hunters dont have to roll ACC to inflict hunter tool damage.

Whenever the hunter activates a hunter tool, a Insight roll must be performed and then resisted by a Sanity Roll.

Hunter Tools use up quicksilver bullets, some more than others.

### Blood Communion
The hunter can give his blood to others in order to heal them.

For each 5 HP spent, the hunter can perform one Blood Communion roll to heal his comrade. However his fellow hunter shall resist the temptation with a Blood Drunkeness roll that must be resisted by a Sanity Roll. 

A hunter can perform one Blood Communion roll per round, however he can perform three extra Blood Communion rolls in between rounds, however leaving him and his fellow hunter exposed. If the one receiving blood moves or attacks in that meantime, the Blood Communion is interrupted.

If a hunter is hit while giving blood, his guard is automatically broken.


### Use Buff
Buffs increase damage in weapons against certain enemies or apply effects temporarily to certain weapons. Buffs can last a certain amount of rounds or last for a certain amount of strikes. 

### Use Throwables
Throwables inflict specific damage or effects instantly upon hitting an enemy. 

An ACC roll needs to be done in order to land the throwable on an enemy, however if the target is an general area close to any foe, the Hit Difficulty of the throw in that area is half the Hit Difficulty of the foe affected. 

If there are multiple foes of different Hit Difficulties in the area, the throw Hit Roll will affect only those whose half their Hit Difficulty was achieved.

The damage caused by area of effect is always cut in half.


### Use Vial of Blood
Hunters can partake in the old blood to heal themselves in battle. 

Vials of Blood have their own BLT associated, which varies depending on their source.

One vial of Blood always heals (1d10 + BLT from the Blood), an per each vial used the hunter must do a Blood Drunkeness Roll to be resisted by a Sanity Roll.


### Charge Strong Attack
Charging a strong attack grants a x2 multiplier in the next attack performed regardless of critical hits. All multipliers stack.

However once a hunter starts charging his strong attack, the attack must be performed on the same round as the charging began and no extra actions can be performed in the same round.


### Parry
When a hunter sees an enemy about to perform an attack against him, the Hunter can perform a parry. 

This movement action counts as a damageless ranged attack, requiring an ACC roll to hit. The Parry Difficulty in enemies however tends to be different from the sheer Hit Difficulty, sometimes being higher to achieve. 

If the hunter`s ACC roll succeeds, the attack from the foe interrupts, breaking his guard imediately, leaving him open for a visceral attack or double the damage in the next attack.


### Communication
Any form of communication is allowed for free during Battle.

### Transform Trick Weapon
The hunter can transform their weapon at will during Battle, unless specified otherwise by the weapons instruction. 


### Perform Visceral Attack
If the hunter is at close range (less than 6 meters away from his foe), he can perform a visceral on any enemy that has their guard broken. 

This will however cease the guard break, including the one round stun that it inflicts on the enemy, while also immediately ending the hunters round. 

## Extra Actions
Hunter can get any new regular action upon using Stamina Points, they can also turn this regular action into two movement actions to use during the round. However some specific actions can only be performed by spending Stamina Points, for example:

### Rally
Hunters can spend 1 Stamina Points to Rally. After a hunter is hit and suffers damage, he can spend 1 Stamina Point immediately after the damage taken, to perform a counter attack.

 This attack requires an ACC roll and damage roll as usual, however the hunter can heal his HP by the same amount of damage he deals in the Rally. 

 Some effects can increase rally potential.

### Dodge
When a hunter is about to get hit, they can spend a Stamina Point to attempt a Dodge. 

A Dodge increases your Defense attribute for the incoming attack. 

Dodge Roll = (SKL)d10

After the roll, your defense for the incoming attack will be DEF + Dodge Roll.
