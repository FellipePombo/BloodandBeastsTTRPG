>## Scourge
>Each dice in a Attack Damage roll (only for damage rolls calculated by SKL,STR or BTH) that results in a value higher or equal to 10 - BTH is considered a Scourge Dice. In the next Attack Damage roll done by the hunter, the damage will be:<br><br>
Hunter Damage = Attack Damage + (Scourge Dice)d10 <br><br>
Scourge Dice stack until the effect remains, however if the hunter takes damage, the damage suffered will be: <br><br>
Damage taken = Damage of enemy attack + (Scourge Dice)d6 <br><br>
The hunter will lose 2 + (Insight) Scourge dice per round.<br><br>
All scourge dice are lost once the effect seizes. <br><br>
If the hunter gets no new Scourge Dice after 5 rounds, all dice are lost and the effect seizes naturally.
